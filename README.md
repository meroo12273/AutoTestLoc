# AutoTestLoc
The modern technological landscape places major significance on the field of software development.
As software applications become more complex and widespread, it is essential to make sure that development processes are efficient and high-quality. 
Within this domain, code fault localization and software testing receive special attention. 
Creating test cases by hand is a laborious and time-consuming process in traditional software testing, particularly for intricate systems. 
Big language models, praised for their ability to comprehend natural language, have gained traction in a number of fields, including natural language processing.
An exciting and new field of study is using these models to generate automated test cases and locate faults. These models have the ability to comprehend both semantics and code syntax, 
which has the potential to completely transform software testing. Through examining code structure and context, they can produce human-readable test cases that are customized to meet requirements, 
increasing efficiency and improving fault localization accuracy. To facilitate more effective software testing and quality assurance procedures and to shift software development paradigms
toward dependability and high quality in the age of technology, this research attempts to harness the potential of large language models.
